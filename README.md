Thanks for uploading your Jupyter notebook: **Speech\_Recognition\_ (1).ipynb**. Based on the content of the notebook, I’ll create a professional `README.md` file. First, I’ll review the contents of your notebook to understand its purpose, libraries used, functionalities, and usage.

Let me start by analyzing your notebook.


The notebook appears to contain programs related to **speech recognition**, starting with **Program 1: Capture Sound and Convert to Digital Signal**. I’ll now analyze the code to understand the libraries used and what each section does, so I can generate an accurate and useful `README.md`.


Here's what we can observe from the initial code:

* The notebook installs dependencies like `portaudio19-dev` and `sounddevice`.
* It reads a `.wav` audio file (`harvard.wav`) using `scipy.io.wavfile`.
* The goal is to perform audio processing, likely for speech recognition purposes.

I’ll now prepare a `README.md` file summarizing:

* Project title and description
* Features
* Installation instructions
* Usage
* Requirements
* License (optional)

Let's draft the README.


Here is a sample `README.md` file for your **Speech Recognition** project:

# 🎙️ Speech Recognition Using Python

This project demonstrates basic speech processing and recognition using Python. It includes programs to record audio, convert speech to digital signals, and possibly analyze or transcribe speech data using external libraries.

## 📌 Features

- Record sound using your microphone
- Convert audio signals to a digital format
- Read and process `.wav` files
- Basic preparation for speech recognition workflows

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `sounddevice`
  - `scipy`
  - `numpy`

## 🔧 Installation

Before running the notebook, make sure the following dependencies are installed:

```bash
# System dependencies
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev

# Python packages
pip install sounddevice scipy numpy
````

## 📂 Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure you have the required audio file (e.g., `harvard.wav`) in the correct directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Speech_Recognition_.ipynb
```

4. Run the cells step by step to:

   * Record and analyze audio
   * View sampling rates and signal data
   * Prepare data for further speech recognition tasks

## 📁 File Structure

* `Speech_Recognition_.ipynb` – The main notebook with annotated code for speech processing.

## ✅ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Internet access for installing packages
* Microphone for audio input
